# A JWT authentication middleware for the Haskell Snap framework

This library is released to Hackage as [snaplet-sqlite-simple-jwt-auth](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snaplet-sqlite-simple-jwt-auth).

See the https://github.com/nurpax/snap-reactjs-todo project for a full
application using this library.  It implements a todo application as an SPA
using React and Redux with a Haskell API server running on Snap and uses
this library to implement logins and route authentication.  This
[blog post](http://nurpax.github.io/posts/2016-11-01-react-redux-haskell-snap.html)
has a walk-through of the application's source code.
